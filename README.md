# multiflow-rslvq
An implementation of the Robust Soft Learning Vector Quantizatin, which works with the scikit-multiflow streaming data framework.

## Known Issues
The following issues could be recognized:

   - At the moment --> Everything seems to work well :-)

## To-Dos
The main file is stream_rslvq_test.py which uses our class RSLVQ from rslvq_stream.py.

For To-Dos check the following tasks:
   
   - Implement RMSprop and Adadelta as optimization algorithms for the gradient descent
   - Remove unnecessary logging
